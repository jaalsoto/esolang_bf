Esolang_bf Overview
===================

Esolang_bf provides two Brainfuck interpreters: brainfuck.c and brainfuck.bf

brainfuck.c reads its instructions from a file. Its portability details are
as follows:

- wrappable unsigned 8-bit cells
- 30,000 array size
- out-of-bounds pointers will print a message and exit
- EOF will leave the current cell unchanged

brainfuck.bf reads its instructions from standard input and the interpreter
on which it is run must support wrappable cells.

Programs run on brainfuck.bf must end with the "%" delimiter character. All
characters before the "%" will be understood as instructions to be executed
and any characters located afterwards will be used as the keyboard input.

==============
Usage Examples
==============

The following commands:

    1. make

    2. ./esolang_bf file

will instruct brainfuck.c to run the instructions in "file".

The following commands:

    1. make

    2. echo "%" >> file && cat file | ./esolang_bf brainfuck.bf

will instruct brainfuck.c to run the instructions in brainfuck.bf who will in
turn run the instructions in "file". Assumes "%" was not already appended.

The following commands:

    1. make

    2. echo "%abc" >> file && cat file | ./esolang_bf brainfuck.bf

will operate in the same fashion as the previous example. Assumes "%" was not
already appended. "a", "b", and "c" will be used as keyboard input.
